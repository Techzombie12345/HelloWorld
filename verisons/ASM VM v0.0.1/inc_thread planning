//loc_CT is on an active thread (otherwise you wouldn't have gotten here)

inc thread
if 8th byte is ff (outside the range of memory jmp to dead_thread
otherwise jmp to loc_start and rerun the code

dead_check:
if hits a dead thread you've reached the last thread, but you'll have to patch the terminated threads before looping to the first thread again

previous thread must have been a running thread
	record previous thread in a register (val_top)
	record first dead thread (Dbase)
	count running threads after first dead thread(s)
	record the last of this running set in another register val_Ctop
	move each running thread to the first open dead thread Cbottom over Dbase
	subtract Ctop from top
	if outcome is zero all threads have been fixed SO
		reset loc_CT
		jmp to loc_start

	if not repeat the process again until the outcome is zero
